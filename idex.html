    <h1>My Favourite Sport</h1>
    <p>My favorite sport is football. I love the excitement and intensity it brings, with its fast-paced action and strategic gameplay. Football requires a mix of physical strength, speed, and skill, which makes every game thrilling to watch and play. The teamwork involved is what makes it so special, as players must communicate and rely on each other to succeed. I enjoy both the challenge of improving my own skills and the camaraderie that comes with playing in a team. Whether it's scoring a goal or making a great pass, football provides a sense of achievement. Watching professional matches also motivates me to become better and fuels my passion for the game.</p>
